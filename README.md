Code Assignments of Deep Learning for Text and Sequences (89-687): http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~89-687/

## Assignment 1
- The code was written in python 2.7, using the numpy package. 
- Implementation of a log-linear classifier and a multi-layer perceptron classifier.
- The classifiers were tested on the language identification task, and the XOR task.

## Assignment 2
- The code was written in python 2.7, using the DyNet package.
- An Implementation of a sequence tagger with window-based features and embeddings.

## Assignment 3
- The code was written in python 2.7, using the DyNet package.
- An implementation of a squence tagger with LSTM.
- Generate different examples to make the LSTM succeed/fail.
